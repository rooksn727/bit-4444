        <p>I am currently a senior in BIT-DSS and am very excited about what this course
            Might be able to teach me! I like web development in my free time as well as some
            light programming projects.

        <p>
            I like to think that I have a lot of different hobbies over the years. I recall that I started programming senior year of highschool.
            I also learned how to drive a stick-shift car and was pretty good a the yoyo.
            Currently I find cybersecurity and IT very intriguing and love solving puzzles and problems. 
            I am also a well traveled person having lived in several different countries over the course of my life.
