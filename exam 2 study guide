4. Major Topics

1) DOM
• What is DOM
  - Document Object Model
    - Both HTML and XML are specified in DOM
    - Is an internal map of the HTML/XML document
      - the root element is still <html>
    - it allows us to access or manipulate a document's elements when writing programs (e.g., JavaScript)

• Node relations (parent, child, sibling, ancestor)
- DOM has a hierarchical tree structure
       - The top level is the document object
       - Each element name is represented by a node
       - A node that contains other nodes is called a parent node
       - A parent node can have many children, but a child node can have only one parent node 
       - Nodes that are peers are called sibling nodes
       - A node’s descendant nodes include its children, its children’s children and so on
       - A node’s ancestor nodes include its parent, its parent’s parent and so on

2) JavaScript
• Differences between JavaScript and Java
  
  - JavaScript
      - needs a browser
      - client side execution
      - HTML element used to specify JavaScript code is script
   
    - Main Differences:
      - no graphical UI
      - No read/write file access on clients
      - Not a class-based object model
      - No multithreading
      - Do not need the Java VM (needs a browser to operate)
      
• What JavaScript can do and when to use JavaScript
  - Client-side:
       Control browser features
       Modify document appearance
       Modify document content
       Store & use information about user
       Manipulate images
       React to state of browser and client system
       More

  
• Where to put JavaScript code
  - Embedded into HTML
      - can be inserted anywhere in the HTML file, including the body
      - There are no limits on how many <script> tags can be embedded in the HTML code of a web page.
            
            Example: 
              <head>
                <title>JavaScriptEx</title>
                <script type="text/javascript">
                      ***Where the code goes***
                </script>
              </head>
              <body>

  - Putting the JavaScript in its own local file
      - THIS IS THE BEST WAY FOR CODE REUSE
      - use of src: src = specify URL of external code source
      - use of type: type = specifies scripting language
 
              Example:
              <head>
                <title>JavaEx</title>
                <scrpit src="inputValidator.js"
                        type="text/javascript"></script>
