       - A node that contains other nodes is called a parent node
       - A parent node can have many children, but a child node can have only one parent node 
       - Nodes that are peers are called sibling nodes
       - A node’s descendant nodes include its children, its children’s children and so on
       - A node’s ancestor nodes include its parent, its parent’s parent and so on

• Node relations (parent, child, sibling, ancestor)
